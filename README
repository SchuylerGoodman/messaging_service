=================

C++ Messaging Service - CS360

Synchronization Locations:
Buffer.h - Buffer.cpp:
    Queue for accepting client interaction
    Where the threads get client ids
    Protected by mutex and condition variables
    It is poorly named, I know

MessageList.h - MessageList.cpp:
    Data structure protecting a std::map where messages are stored for users
    Protected from multiple readers/writers by mutex
